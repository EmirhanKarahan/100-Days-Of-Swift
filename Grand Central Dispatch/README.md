### Note

In all other challenges, we had a completely new idea or building on top of the other projects.
However, this time we have 3 old projects to update. That is why this folder includes 3 project folders.

#### Challenge

Modify **Project 1 - Storm Viewer** so that loading the list of NSSL images from our bundle happens in the background. Make sure you call reloadData() on the table view once loading has finished!
Modify **Project 8 - 7 Swifty Words** so that loading and parsing a level takes place in the background. Once you’re done, make sure you update the UI on the main thread!
Modify **Project 7 - Whitehouse Petitions** so that your filtering code takes place in the background. This filtering code was added in one of the challenges for the project, so hopefully you didn’t skip it!
